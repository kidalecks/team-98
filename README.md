<h2>The Digital Divide</h2>

<p>The 21st century has brought about a revolution in technology that has advanced how we interact and communicate across the world. Not everyone has access to this technology, though, leading to a "digital divide". Stanford defines the digital divide as "the growing gap between the underprivileged members of society....and the wealthy, middle-class, and young Americans living in urban and suburban areas who have access". It is an intersectional issue with different factors factoring into a person's access to adequate technology and internet speeds.</p>

Over the past year, the pandemic has shown us how essential the internet is in our modern world. Without access to online tools and resources, individuals are increasingly unable to fully participate in society.

An equitable world--at this point--means a place where everyone has access to the tools of our digital world.
